This directory contains sample parameter files.

Kerr.par is a good one to start with if you want a simple example
of AHFinderDirect usage.  It's my standard "sanity-check" test case
for AHFinderDirect, and runs in a < 10 seconds on a laptop.  It sets
up Kerr/Kerr-Schild initial data and finds the apparent horizon in
it, with the coordinate origin and initial guess offset to make this
a nontrivial test of the apparent horizon finder.

misner1.2-025-init.par sets up Misner initial data (mu=1.2, so there's
a common horizon as well as two separate horizons) and then finds the
apparent horizons in it.

misner1.2-025-init-mask.par is a variant of this that also sets an
old-style (CCTK_REAL) excision mask.

misner-run.par is a more complicated parameter file, which sets up the
same Misner initial data, but now time-evolves it, finding the apparent
horizons at each time step.  (It also runs AHFinder every 20 time steps
for comparison.)  It takes a lot of cpu and memory to run.
