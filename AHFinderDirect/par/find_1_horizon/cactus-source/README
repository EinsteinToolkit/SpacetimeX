README for the Cactus source tree

This directory contains a complete Cactus source tree in several tarballs.
(A tarball is a file with a suffix like ".tar.gz".)
The tarballs were created by the thorn AEIThorns/Formaline when the
corresponding executable was produced, and were stored in the executable.
Thorn CactusUtils/Formaline contains more information about this feature.

In order to fully recreate the Cactus source tree, unpack all tarballs
in this directory, e.g. with commands like
	tar xzf Cactus-source-Cactus.tar.gz
for all tarballs, or
	for T in *.tar.gz; do tar xzf $T; done
in Bash. All tarballs should be unpacked into the same directory.

The files "config-info" and "ThornList" that were used to build the
executable can then be found in the "configs" subdirectory.
