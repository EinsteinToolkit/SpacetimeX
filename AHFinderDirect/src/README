This is the top-level source directory for the AHFinderDirect thorn.
See ../doc/ for further documentation.


Files in this directory:
CODESTYLE	documents some general programming conventions I have
		used in this thorn
make.code.defn	usual Cactus definition of subdirectories


Subdirectories which are *not* used directly in compiling this thorn
within Cactus:
misc/		contains misc source code that's not part of the Cactus
		executable, including the 'mpp' Maple preprocessor used
		by the Maple code in other directories
maple/		contains Maple code to generate C/C++ from complicated
		expressions
cctest/		contains small test programs for checking what features
		various C++ compilers support


Subdirectories which *are* used directly in compiling this thorn
within Cactus; these are listed in top-down order (no code depends
on, or includes header files from, higher-level code):
driver/		contains high-level driver routines to solve the
		Theta(h) = 0 equations and interface to the rest of Cactus
		(all the aliased-function stuff to interface with other
		thorns also lives here)
gr/		contains relativity code; all knowledge of the actual
		apparent horizon equation lives in the code in this directory
gr.cg/		contains Maple-generated C code (generated from Maple
		code in  gr/  subdirectory) to compute the Theta(h)
		function and its Jacobian coefficients
elliptic/	contains code to solve elliptic equations on the multipatch
		$S^2$
sparse-matrix/	constains sparse-matrix libraries imported from outside
		this thorn
patch/		contains the basic multipatch infrastructure for storing
		and finite differencing gridfns in angular coordinates
		on the surface of a 2-sphere
jtutil/		contains various low-level utility routines for things
		like integer <--> floating-point linear maps, fuzzy
		floating-point comparisons, N-dimensional arrays, etc;
		this is the only directory containing C++ templates
include/	contains common header files which don't live in any other
		source directory; all compile-time options for this thorn
		are configured here
