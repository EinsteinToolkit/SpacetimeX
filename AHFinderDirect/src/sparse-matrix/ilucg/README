This directory contains the ILUCG (Incomplete LU-decomposition /
conjugate gradiant) sparse matrix subroutines.

These subroutines were provided to me (JT) by Tom Nicol of the University
of British Columbia Computing Center in 1985; I believe they were originally
written by P. Madderom (also of the UBC Computing Center).

I have slightly modified the convergence criteria.
