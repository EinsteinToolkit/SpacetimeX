This directory holds Maple code for manipulating tensor differential
operators and converting them into C/C++ code.  This code doesn't itself
know any physics, but it does have a few bits of knowledge of our
coordinate systems:
coords.*	define all the coordinates
gfa.minc	defines the X_ud and X_udd coordinate-transformation
		coefficients
