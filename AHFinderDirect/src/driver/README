This directory contains top-level routines to find the apparent horizon
and interface with the rest of Cactus.

The main source files in this directory are as follows:

README.parallel
	design notes for the parallel/multiprocessor algorithms
	and data structures

driver.hh
	overall header file for routines in this directory

state.cc
	state information (data structures) kept across Cactus scheduler calls

setup.cc		# sees CCTK_ARGUMENTS, CCTK_PARAMETERS
	this is called from the scheduler to setup our data structures

find_horizons.cc	# sees CCTK_ARGUMENTS, CCTK_PARAMETERS
	this is called from the scheduler to find the apparent horizon(s)
	in a slice

announce.cc		# sees CCTK_ARGUMENTS, CCTK_PARAMETERS
	this is called from the scheduler to announce apparent horizon
	info to other thorns

mask.cc			# sees CCTK_ARGUMENTS, CCTK_PARAMETERS
	this is called from the scheduler to set an excision mask or masks

initial_guess.cc
	this sets up the initial guess(es) for the horizon position(s)

Newton.cc		# sees cGH (for interprocessor broadcasts)
			# uses CCTK_ReduceLocArrayToArray1D() for
			#   interprocessor broadcast/synchronization
	this solves the Theta(h) = 0 equations by Newton's method

io.cc
	I/O routines

ellipsoid.maple
	this is a Maple script to compute the intersection of a given
	ray with an ellipsoid; this is used in setting up the initial guess
ellipsoid.c
	this is the Maple-generated code from "ellipsoid.maple"
ellipsoid.log
	this is the standard output from running "ellipsoid.maple"
