This directory contains all the code for this thorn which "knows" about
general relativity.

The main source files in this directory are as follows:

expansion.cc
	Computes the expansion $\Theta = \Theta(h)$ of a trial horizon
	surface $r = h(angle)$

expansion_Jacobian.cc
	Computes the Jacobian $J[\Theta(h)]$ of the expansion $\Theta(h)$.

Schwarzschild_EF.cc
	Computes the Schwarzschild/Eddington-Finkelstein g_ij and K_ij

misc.cc
	Misc support routines.

gr.hh
	Overall header file for all the external routines in this directory.

gfns.hh
	Defines the gfns of all the gridfns as enums in namespace gfns::.

cg.hh
	This header file defines the "virtual machine" used by the
	machine-generated code in ../gr.cg/.  This file is "dangerous"
	in that it #defines macros for all the gridfns, which will
	break lots of other code.  See the header comments in this
	file for details.

doit.maple
	Top-level driver for all the Maple code.

maple.log
	This is a log file (transcript) of the Maple computation.

setup_gr_gfas.maple
gr_gfas.minc
	These files define the relativity gridfns for the Maple code,
	eg the 3-metric, 3-extrinsic curvature, etc.

auxiliary.maple
curvature.maple
horizon.maple
	These files compute the $\Theta(h)$ function and the $J[\Theta(h)]$
	coefficients in Maple.

makefile
	This drives the Maple code-generation process; the resulting
	(Maple-generated) C code lives in ../gr.cg/
